# PCPM_std

This work is based on PCPM by Kartik Lakhotia [https://github.com/kartiklakhotia/pcpm](url).

Major modifications are made relating to the data structure: the dynamic allocated 'array's are replaced with safer 'std::vector'. 

Please notice that the performance in term of speed is decreased by 5%~10% due to the rewritting. Constant optimzation will be done in order to catch up the original work.
